#### Introduction

Hi! :wave: These are some resources I have collected on my journey as a coder / software engineer / nerd. Most of these resources are geared towards folks who are very new to coding and software engineering and helped me answer some questions I had that are difficult to navigate as someone new to this field without a formal education in computer science.

I welcome suggestions and comments about your favorite resources or things that should be added or questions you have! My goal is to include free resources that are easy to understand and access.

#### Fun :balloon:

- [Bits and Bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bits_and_Bytes) - Bits and Bytes is a classic, and still foundational, Canadian television series about microcomputers and the key concepts behind them.  It was produced by TVOntario in 1983, and stars Luba Goy as the instructor, and Billy Van as the student.
	- [Youtube Playlist Episodes 1-12](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77441A2ED0D0B6A8) (1983)
	- [Youtube Playlist Bits and Bytes 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBSleF-26L9DYYnUZdD3D-Ja98VxBlpB) (1993)

#### Software Engineering :alien:

As a new programmer, one of the biggest obstacles for me to learning to code was setting up a development environment and all the associated tools and processes. The list below gives you a general overview of what that can look like if you want to set one up for yourself locally. Many classes will provide either a hosted or cloud based environment to you as part of the class or walk you through setting up your local environment step-by-step.  This is a great option if you want more structure and guidance setting up and accessing a development environment.

See the section below called "Free Online Classes" for other notes on development environments.

##### Development Environments

In software, web and mobile application development, the development environment is a workspace with a set of processes and programming tools used to develop the source code for an application or software product.

- [Video: Development Environments and Why You Need One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFZrSNd7jYo)

##### Command Line Terminals and Shells

A [command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt) is a means of interacting with a device or computer program with commands from a user or client, and responses from the device or program, in the form of lines of text.

- [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
	- [Official website + download](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
	- [Official Documentation from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
- [cmd.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands?source=recommendations)

#### read–eval–print loop (REPL)

A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.

##### Text Editors and Interactive Development Environments (IDEs)

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Sublime Text is a shareware text and source code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages
- Atom
- Visual Studio Code

#### Free Online Classes :books:

I enrolled in Coursera for free through the [NYC Department of Labor Program](https://dol.ny.gov/online-learning-coursera) and ended up learning Python initially through Coursera classes. I have linked the classes I took below, although they're not technically *free*.

One advantage of learning through a structured class is the class will provide a development environment for you or guide you step-by-step through setting up your development environment. For me, this was and often still is one of the hardest parts of programming!
