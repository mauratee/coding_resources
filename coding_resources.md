### CODING RESOURCES

---

#### Introduction

Hi! :wave: These are some resources I have collected on my journey as a coder / software engineer / nerd. Most of these resources are geared towards folks who are very new to coding and software engineering and helped me answer some questions I had that are difficult to navigate as someone new to this field without a formal education in computer science.

I welcome suggestions and comments about your favorite resources or things that should be added or questions you have! My goal is to include free resources that are easy to understand and access.
