#### Introduction

Hi! :wave: These are some resources I have collected on my journey as a coder / software engineer / nerd. Most of these resources are geared towards folks who are very new to coding and software engineering and helped me answer some questions I had that are difficult to navigate as someone new to this field without a formal education in computer science.

I welcome suggestions and comments about your favorite resources or things that should be added or questions you have! My goal is to include free resources that are easy to understand and access.

#### Fun :balloon:

- [Bits and Bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bits_and_Bytes) - Bits and Bytes is a classic, and still foundational, Canadian television series about microcomputers and the key concepts behind them.  It was produced by TVOntario in 1983, and stars Luba Goy as the instructor, and Billy Van as the student.
	- [Youtube Playlist Episodes 1-12](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77441A2ED0D0B6A8) (1983)
	- [Youtube Playlist Bits and Bytes 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBSleF-26L9DYYnUZdD3D-Ja98VxBlpB) (1993)
	- [Youtube Playlist Computer Academy, includes Bits and Bytes plus additional episodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBSleF-26L80dFdwyeYRguQty9M2hz3L) (1983)

#### Software Engineering :alien:

As a new programmer, one of the biggest obstacles to learning to code is setting up a development environment and all the associated tools and processes. The list below gives you a general overview of what that can look like if you want to set one up for yourself locally. Many classes will provide either a hosted or cloud based environment to you as part of the class or walk you through setting up your local environment step-by-step.  This is a great option if you want more structure and guidance setting up and accessing a development environment.

See the section below called "Free Online Classes" for other notes on development environments.

##### Development Environments

- [Video: Development Environments and Why You Need One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFZrSNd7jYo)

##### Command Line Terminals and Shells

- bash
- Powershell
- cmd.exe

##### Text Editors and IDEs

- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Visual Studio Code

#### Free Online Classes :books:

I enrolled in Coursera for free through the [NYC Department of Labor Program](https://dol.ny.gov/online-learning-coursera) and ended up learning Python initially through Coursera classes. I have linked the classes I took below, although they're not technically *free*.

One advantage of learning through a structured class is the class will provide a development environment for you or guide you step-by-step through setting up your development environment. For me, this was and often still is one of the hardest parts of programming!

###### Languages

	- [Coursera: Data Collection and Processing with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-collection-processing-python?specialization=python-3-programming) (16 hours)
